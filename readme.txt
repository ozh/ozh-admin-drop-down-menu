All admin links available in a neat horizontal drop down menu. Saves lots of screen real estate!


== Description ==

The lazy and the productive will love it : all admin links available in a neat horizontal CSS driven drop down menu. No need to click on "Manage" then "Pages" to edit pages. And plenty more space on your screen.

For documentation, examples and screenshots, please refer to the official plugin page for [Admin Drop Down Menu](http://planetozh.com/blog/my-projects/wordpress-admin-menu-drop-down-css/ "Admin Drop Down Menu"). There is also an API for plugin coders (give your plugin its own special icon!).
